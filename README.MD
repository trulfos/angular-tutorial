# Angular Tutorial
This repository contains sildes and some sandbox code for a angular tutorial.
Be warned: Some of the code is a bit messy, so don't look too much at it. The
user interface is also terrible.


## Slides
Start an HTTP server in the root directory, e. g.:
```python -m SimpleHTTPServer```
and access `http://localhost:8000/`.

## Sandbox
No server necessary. Open `sandbox/index.html` in a browser. Edit
`sandbox/index.html` and `sandbox/app.js` to experiment.
